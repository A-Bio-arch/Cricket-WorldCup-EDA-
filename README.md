Cricket World Cup EDA Project
Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Cricket World Cup dataset. The dataset comprises seven tables, each representing different aspects of cricket matches, players, teams, overs, and venues. The objective is to gain insights into the historical performance of teams, players, and venues during the Cricket World Cup.

Dataset Structure
Innings_c: Contains information about each inning, including player statistics, scores, and outcomes.

Matches: Provides details about individual matches, such as teams, dates, venues, and match outcomes.

Players: Contains information about cricket players participating in the World Cup.

Teams: Describes various cricket teams, including team details and countries.

OverBall: Presents detailed data about overs, including the bowler, batsman, and over-specific information.

OverHistory_c: Includes historical data on overs, highlighting ball-by-ball information.

Venues: Encompasses details about cricket venues, including location and stadium information.

Steps Performed
Data Cleaning: Each table underwent a rigorous data cleaning process to handle missing values, correct data types, and ensure consistency.

EDA on Individual Tables: Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted separately for each table to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and unveil insights specific to each dataset.

Table Concatenation and Joins: Tables with common entities were concatenated and joined to perform more comprehensive EDA across related datasets.

Challenges
Missing Data: The dataset contained missing values in various columns, which were carefully addressed during the cleaning process.

Mismatched Entries: Tables exhibited differences in entries, requiring meticulous handling to align and combine the data accurately.

Key Insights
Team Performance: Analysis of match outcomes, victories, and run rates provided insights into the performance of cricket teams.

Player Statistics: Examination of player data allowed for the identification of key players and their contributions.

Venue Analysis: Venue-specific EDA uncovered patterns related to match locations and their impact on outcomes.

Conclusion
Despite the challenges posed by the heterogeneity of the dataset, this EDA project successfully revealed valuable insights into the Cricket World Cup's historical data. The documentation and cleaning steps undertaken ensure the reliability of the findings, making this project a valuable resource for cricket enthusiasts and data analysts alike.
